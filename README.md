Usage of chaindb.exe:
  -d string
        Data directory to serve files from.
  -e string
        The URL of the ElasticSearch server.
  -p int
        Port to serve on (default 80)
  -r string
        The domain that this utility is served under. Valid values include 192.168.2.1:80, app.example.net, and example.net
  -s string
        The subdirectory of the domain this utility will be served under. If this is set to "db" then the page found normally at example.com/a.html will instead be found at example.com/db/a.html
```

Still in early development.
